# Molecule_Activity_Machine_Learning

In this mini-project I attempt to train a model to classify a set of molecules as biologically active or inactive. Such processes are common in drug discovery in the pharmaceutical sciences. Real research data is used, and therefore cannot be made publically available: here the focus is data wrangling and model training. From a learning data scientist's point of view the data set is interesting in that there are over 400 features and an imbalance of data (1000 active vs 140 inactive).

The notebook was run using Python 3.6.1 with the following modules:

numpy 1.17.2
pandas 0.24.2
matplotlib 3.1.1
sklearn  0.21.3
imblearn 0.5.0
xgboost 0.9
